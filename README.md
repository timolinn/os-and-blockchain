# Operating Systems and Blockchain

I created this repository to document my learnings on Blockchain technologies and operating systems (especially unix systems).

This journey started with [Learning Rust](https://github.com/timolinn/the-year-of-the-rustacean) and basic C, which I hope will be enough to help me understand the Linux APIs, just enough to communicate with it using rust FFI.

My goal is to arrive at a substantial level of expertise two years from now God willing.

This will be a concurrent learning experience, I have designed my weekly routine to revolve around 3 days of Blockchain and 3 days of Operating Systems. The remaining day, Sunday, I shall strive get some rest.
