# Operating Systems and Blockchain

I created this repository to document my learnings on Blockchain technology and operating systems (especially unix-like systems eg. Reenix, Linux). 

This journey started with [Learning Rust](https://github.com/timolinn/the-year-of-the-rustacean) and the C programming language, which I hope will be enough to help me understand the Linux APIs.
